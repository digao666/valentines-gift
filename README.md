# Valentine's Gift - Stardew Valley Fishing Mini Game

## About
With Valentine's coming up, I was thinking of what gift to give to my girlfriend. I knew she liked Stardew Valley, as we are currently playing it. Especially how she told me she always liked the fishing mini-game.

So, here we go, a ***very*** dodgy implementation of the fishing game. Complete with missing animations and sound. I made this in less than a day's worth of time. This was my very first attempt at using Phaser 3, which I enjoyed very much working with.

If I were to make this again, I would perhaps start earlier. Bad jokes aside, I would create a couple more demo games in Phaser 3 or even another game engine like Godot. This would give me the confidence to deliver a more polished game. Plus, I would need to work more on the asset part (sprites, animations, sound, etc.).

Feel free to modify this and make it better, and perhaps give it to someone you like.
